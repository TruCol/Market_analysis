We expect that the main points for improvement in this analysis are the datapoints that are used. In particular the generalisation of the profit margin of the logistics sector to other sectors could be replaced by the actual data of the other sectors. Furthermore, the profit margin of the logistics sector could be searched directly instead of deriving it based on the of its larger companies.
