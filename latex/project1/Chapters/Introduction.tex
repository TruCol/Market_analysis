\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Welcome, this document presents our market analysis for the TruCol consultancy. Since we currently have little experience on this topic within our team we are making our data and assumptions as transparant as possible, both in this document as in our code. This way we hope to improve our model based on your feedback by enabling you tingle with it yourself.

This market analysis estimates the total adressable market (TAM) as well as the total servicable market (TSM) for a consultancy service that is being developed to help companies get the most out of the TruCol protocol. Since this market analysis consists of a rough estimate, three different estimation methods are used for generating the TAM and TSM estimates. The redundancy is introduced to establish some overview/reference results.

The assumptions and datapoints for the respective models are specified in \cref{sec:assumptions}. Next, the models are described in \cref{sec:model_description} (the Python models themselves are included as appendices in \cref{app:0} to \cref{app:2} respectively). The results of these models are presented in \cref{sec:results}. To shed some light on how sensitive the model is to for example changes in assumptions, a sensitivity analysis is presented for each model in \cref{sec:sensitity_analysis}. Next the results and sensitivity of the models are discussed in \cref{sec:discussion} and a conclusion is provided in \cref{sec:conclusion}.

We invite you to tinker with the assumptions and models yourself! The data and plots in this report are automatically updated if you run \verb+python -m code.project1.src+. If you experience any difficulties in running the code, simply reach out to us, (click on issues on the github page) and we are happy to get you running the code.
