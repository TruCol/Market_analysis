\section{Market Analysis Models}\label{sec:market_analysis_model}
This section describes the model that is used to perform the market analysis for the TruCol company service. The model will be used to estimate the yearly revenue that is projected for this company. Typical estimation models to do this for startups are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Top Down Model} - Starts with a large population with known size that make up the target market, and then narrows the market size down to the specific market segment.
	\item \textit{Bottom Up Model} - Takes current pricing and/or usage of product as a starting point and extrapolates up/outwards to compute the potential market size.
	\item \textit{Value Theory Model} - estimates the value provided to customers and estimates how much of that value can be reflected in the product pricing.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Since the TruCol company does not yet have a large body of current pricing and product usage, the Bottom Up Model is not used in this market analysis document. Similarly, the Value Theory Model is omitted in this market analysis as it is most powerful on historical data which is not yet available for the TruCol protocol. Since the market sizes of most sectors in which the TruCol company intends to operate, the Top Down Model is used to derive a rough estimate of the projected yearly revenue for the TruCol company.
