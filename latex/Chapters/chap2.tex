To use the Top Down Model, \cref{subsec:total_addressable_market} describes the TAM in which the TruCol company will operate. To this end, \cref{subsubsec:tam_logistics} discusses the market size of the logistics market, and the profit within that market. Due to time-constraints and lack of data, some datapoints and assumptions of the logistics market are applied to other sectors such as the automated trading market and pharmaceutics market in \cref{subsubsec:additional_markets} to get some insight in their respective market sizes. Furthermore, \cref{subsubsec:emerging_markets} provides some qualitative insight in the potential future markets that are highly suited for the TruCol protocol. These emerging markets are accordingly expected to be relevant markets to address in the near future.

\subsection{Total Addressable Market}\label{subsec:total_addressable_market}
To compute the TAM, SAM and SOM, some form of market definition can be used. To this end, it is considered valuable to specify what the TruCol company does, where it adds value and how it does that. Furthermore, since these three aforementioned estimates pertain to a potential future, the potential, yet deemed feasible, activities of the TruCol company are included.
\\
The TruCol company provides advice and support to companies on how they can get the most out of the TruCol protocol. To understand this, the following assumptions are shared. Under these assumptions, one can conclude that an economically rational company would try to off-load as much of their required tasks into the TruCol protocol as it would minimise their operational costs and/or improve algorithmic efficiency of their solutions.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{asu-0:} Solutions to tasks that are completed using the TruCol protocol are deterministically verifiable.
	\item \textbf{asu-1:} Solutions to tasks that are completed using the TruCol protocol are of sufficient quality.
	\item \textbf{asu-2:} Tasks that are completed using the TruCol protocol can be solved for the lowest cost price that is currently available in this world.
	\item \textbf{asu-3:} No personnel needs to be attracted, screened, hired nor fired for tasks that are completed using the TruCol protocol.
	\item \textbf{asu-4:} Companies can benefit from public particular solutions to their task specifications.
	\item \textbf{asu-5:} By sampling from a bigger talent pool (this world), the average performance of the solutions will be better than what is produced by the in-house talent pool, or, for equal solution performance, a faster rate of development can be obtained on average for an equal or lower price.
\end{itemize}



We help companies identify the tasks for which they can use the TruCol protocol, and we assist them in writing safe test specifications that are not easily hackable. This implies that under the given set of assumptions, the TAM for the TruCol protocol can be defined as the total costs that the companies (and consumers) in this world are willing to pay for assistance on using the TruCol protocol.

\subsubsection{TruCol Total Addressable Logistics Market}\label{subsubsec:tam_logistics}

This sub-sub section illustrates a rough method of estimating the logistics sub-segment of the TAM for the TruCol protocol. To do this, an example of algorithmic optimalisation within the logistics market as presented by McKinsey \& Company is generalised conservatively to a rough estimate of the total logistics market size.

A clear example of a logistics company successfully hiring a support for algorithmic optimalisation is documented by McKinsey \& Company in the "how they help their clients" segment of their website\cite{mckinsey_algo}. The study how reports McKinsey's team, among which McKinsey's Strategic Network Analytic Center, helped an Asian logistics company. With McKinseys team, the logistics company realised an \textit{in line haul network cost} reduction of 3.6\% while reducing their \textit{transit time} with 0.8\%, yielding an overall 16\% increase in profit for the logistics company, without compromising the quality. To use this report as a valuable resource to generate some rough estimates on market size, the following assumptions are made:

 \begin{itemize}
 	\item \textbf{asu-6:} The logistics company made a net profit by hiring McKinsey \& Company in this particular ordeal.
	\item \textbf{asu-7:} The example of a 16\% increase in profit is generalizable to a conservative potential 0.1\% of profit increases through algorithmic optimalisation across the entire logistics industry.
	\item \textbf{asu-8:} Companies are willing to pay at least 1 \% of their potential profit increases for the assistance the TruCol company provides in identifying opportunities for optimisation and for improving test-specification security.
\end{itemize}

Based on those assumptions, one could find a potential yearly profit increase across the entire logistics sector by summing the net profit of the logistics sector. \cite{cips} claims that this company \cite{transparency_market_research} valued the logistics market at 8.1 trillion in 2016. Additionally, \cite{cips} claims \cite{transparency_market_research} estimates the logistics market value will grow to 15.5 trillion in 2023. However, no figures on profit are found. Therefore, individual companies are explored.

For DHL one can find on pdf page 37/170 in \cite{dhl_2019_annual_report} that the annual profit for DHL in 2019 was 4.1 billion.

For UPS one can find on pdf page 4/257 in \cite{ups_2020_annual_report} that the annual unadjusted operating profit for UPS in 2020 was 7.7 billion. Note, \cite{ups_q21_earnings_call} says UPS had a net operating profit of 1.1 billion in Q1 of 2020, implying they had to almost double their average profit in the remaining three quarters of 2020 to be consistent with an annual 7.7 billion.

For FedEx the net income as reported for 2020 has been 1.29 \$ billion in pdf page 2/17 \cite{fedex_2020_annual_report}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Asu-9:} The net income as reported (GAAP) by FedEx can be interpreted as the profit by FedEx.
\end{itemize}

Next, the claim that fragmentation of the global market implied in 2016 that Deutsche Post DHL, Ceva Logistics, UPS, and FedEx, control less than 15\% of that global market allows estimating a limit on the net global profit made in the logistics market based on the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Asu-10:} The market segment in the global logistics market maintained by the combination of DHL, UPS and FedEx is at most 15\% in 2020.
	\item \textbf{Asu-11:} The profit in the remaining 85\% of the global logistics market has the same average yearly profitability per percent market share as the combination of DHL, UPS and FedEx.
\end{itemize}

Based on assumptions 1-11 one could estimate an upperbound of
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		net-profit_{DHL+UPS+FedEx}=4.1+7.7+1.29=13.09 billion\\
		\frac{net-profit_{global\_logistics}}{net-profit_{DHL+UPS+FedEx}}=\frac{0.85}{0.15}\\
		net-profit_{global\_logistics}=net-profit_{DHL+UPS+FedEx}\frac{0.85}{0.15}\\
		net-profit_{global\_logistics}=\frac{13.09\cdot0.85}{0.15}\\
		net-profit_{global\_logistics}=74.2 billion
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

Hence, if each of those companies in the logistics sector could increase their profits on average annually by .1\% using algorithmic optimisation, and if they would use the TruCol protocol to do that, and if they would be willing to invest 1\% of that profit in our support and assistance in getting the most out of the TruCol protocol, we would currently estimate that this would yield roughly an income of $74.2\cdot 0.001\cdot 0.01=\$0.74 million$

\subsubsection{Additional addressable markets}\label{subsubsec:additional_markets}
Since the TruCol company is market agnostic, we also seek to assist in algorithmic optimisation outside the logistics market. Several markets are worth mentioning in particular as we expect them to either heavily rely on algorithmic optimisations, or because they are particularly suited for the TruCol protocol.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{(Automated) trading} In the highly competitive market of (automated) trading, algorithmic optimisations are key to making successful trades.
	\item \textbf{Space Sector} The space engineering sector already has a relatively high test driven development\cite{todo}, this lowers the adoption costs of the TruCol protocol relative to most industries. Furthermore, space applications are heavily mass constrained, which generally makes them highly energy constrained as well. These energy constraints emphasise the importance of algorithmic optimisations, for example in telecommunications satellites and swarm robots.
	\item \textbf{Innovative Materials Research} The domain of material science has been adopting algorithmic search strategies to find new materials  \cite{allahyari2020coevolutionary}.
	\item \textbf{Pharmaceutical Industry} Another example of a large market that has been shifting to adopt algorithmic search strategies to find new medicines.
\end{itemize}
Each of these are multi-billion dollar markets which can contribute to the TAM of the TruCol company.

\subsubsection{Emerging markets}\label{subsubsec:emerging_markets}
Beyond those listed markets, the following emerging markets could be great opportunities for the TruCol company to latch in and grow along in.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Neuromorphic Computing} This field is developing new complexity theory to adapt to the unconventional computation methods. This is an interesting opportunity to explore the versatility of the TruCol protocol.
	\item \textbf{Quantum Computing} This is another upcoming field with many new algorithmic implementations. The newness of the field may suggest that the amount of optimisation and exploration to be done is relatively high, possibly indicating a relatively large potential for the TruCol protocol. However, currently our team does not yet contain experience in this type of algorithmic developments.
	\item \textbf{Artificial Intelligence} With the introduction of GPT-3 and GitHub Copilot, the world has seen examples of AI engines that are able to generate code for some basic tasks. The TruCol protocol could catalyse the usage of such AI engines that are able to write code based on requirement specification. We expect that users of the TruCol protocol will develop a tactical advantage on requirement specifications for AI engines.
