\section{TruCol Company Business Model}\label{sec:trucol_company_business_model}
Since the market size estimation modelling is somewhat of an abstract/subjective task, a Monte-Carlo simulation is created of a Top-Down model.

\subsection{Revenue Format}
Before the model is presented, it is important to realise that we propose an optimisation service. This means that if a certain activity, e.g. a logistics company has operational cost of 5 \$million/day, our service is only able to earn at most the margin of improvement we are able to bring our customer. Suppose the independent usage of the TruCol provides the customer with a 2\% optimisation in their operational costs, yielding them $5.000.000\cdot 0.02=\$100.000/day$. Suppose our expertise is able to enable them to yield a 3\% optimisation by identifying the relevant development/system processes and supporting them in improved test specification. In that assumption our company would bring them an additional 3-2=1\% which would translate roughly to \$$50.000$. That would be the value we bring to the logistics company in this hypothetical scenario.

In reality this example is oversimplified, the 2\% the company could get by themselves would involve some risk pertaining to inaccurate test specification which could lead to loss of the bounty. Our company reduces this risk by providing test-specification security expertise. Furthermore, our interaction with the client may bring the client experience that can be applied in future applications of the TruCol protocol, hence the value to we bring to the client is larger than the amount they gain in terms of optimisation w.r.t. the case where they use the protocol themselves.
