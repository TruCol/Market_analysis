A rough estimate based on various datasources has been generated to estimate the yearly revenue of the TruCol company. Additional iterations with improved datapoints is recommended to obtain a more accurate estimate. The market analysis does not yet include the growth that may be captured in diversification, emerging markets such as neuromorphic computing and in-house automation/AI-engines. Before taking these potentials into account, however, a more accurate assessment of the starting market is recommended.
